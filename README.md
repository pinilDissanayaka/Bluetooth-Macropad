# Bluetooth-Macropad

## Description
A customizable Bluetooth macropad built with ESP32, featuring programmable keys and RGB lighting. This project allows users to configure the macropad's layout and lighting effects through an intuitive interface.

## Introduction
This repository contains the firmware and configuration files for a customizable Bluetooth macropad based on the ESP32 microcontroller. The macropad features RGB lighting and programmable keys, allowing for personalized setups and dynamic lighting effects.

## Features
- Bluetooth Connectivity: Easily pair with your computer or device.
- Customizable Macros: Program custom key functions and shortcuts.
- RGB Lighting: Dynamic and customizable RGB lighting effects.
- User-Friendly Configuration: Simple interface for adjusting key mappings and lighting.

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 development board (e.g., ESP32 DevKit v1)
- Mechanical switches (e.g., Gateron, Cherry MX)
- RGB LEDs (e.g., WS2812B)
- Keycaps

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- ESP32 Board Support Package
- Adafruit NeoPixel Library
- ESP32 BLE Keyboard Library

## Installation
